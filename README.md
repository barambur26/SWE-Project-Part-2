SWE Project: A CLI for Trustworthy Model Re-Use
This project is a command-line interface (CLI) developed for ACME Corporation to help its service engineering teams evaluate and choose trustworthy, pre-trained AI/ML models from open-source ecosystems like Hugging Face.

The tool analyzes model repositories from various URLs (Hugging Face, GitHub) and calculates a series of quality and trustworthiness metrics. It outputs a final weighted "Net Score" for each model, allowing engineers to quickly assess its suitability for re-use in ACME's products, which are licensed under LGPLv2.1.

## Features & Metrics
The CLI evaluates models based on several key metrics, which are then combined to produce a final "Net Score".


üìà Performance Claims: Assesses the evidence of a model's performance by checking its Hugging Face cardData for a model-index with benchmark results. The score is nudged upwards by high download and like counts.


‚öñÔ∏è License: Checks the model's license for compatibility with ACME's open-source policies (LGPLv2.1). It scores based on whether the license is compatible (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT), incompatible (e.g., GPL-3.0), or unclear.



‚è±Ô∏è Ramp-Up Time: Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the model's README.md file. It scores the documentation's clarity and completeness to estimate the effort required for an engineer to start using the model ("ramp-up time").


üöå Bus Factor: Measures the concentration of knowledge among the top contributors to the model's codebase over the last year. A higher score indicates a lower risk of the project becoming unmaintained if a key developer leaves.


üíª Code Quality: Evaluates the quality of the associated codebase by checking for the presence of dependency files (e.g., requirements.txt, pyproject.toml) and the proportion of Python files in the repository.


üì¶ Dataset & Code Availability: Scores the model based on whether it links to datasets, provides source code, and includes demos (Hugging Face Spaces).


üìä Dataset Quality: Assesses the quality of any associated datasets by checking for documentation (cardData), high download counts, multiple configurations, and the availability of a data viewer on Hugging Face.


üìè Size Score: Evaluates a model's size compatibility with different hardware targets by summing the size of its weight files (.bin, .safetensors, etc.). It returns a dictionary of scores for the following devices:

raspberry_pi

jetson_nano

desktop_pc

aws_server

## How the Net Score is Calculated
The overall Net Score is a weighted sum of the individual metrics listed above. The weights are defined based on project priorities and can be adjusted in scoring.py.

The default weights are:

Metric	Weight
Performance Claims	0.15
Dataset & Code Score	0.15
Dataset Quality	0.15
Ramp-Up Time	0.15
Bus Factor	0.10
License	0.10
Size Score	0.10
Code Quality	0.10

Export to Sheets
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x

An environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN containing a valid GitHub Personal Access Token for API requests.

### Installation
To install all the necessary Python dependencies, run the following command from the root of the repository:

Bash

./run install
This command will install all required packages into your user environment.

## Usage
### Running the Analysis
To analyze models, provide a text file containing a newline-delimited list of URLs. These URLs can point to Hugging Face models, datasets, or GitHub repositories.

Execute the tool with the following command:

Bash

./run /path/to/your/url_file.txt
The program will process the URLs and print the results to standard output in NDJSON format. Each line will contain a JSON object with the calculated scores and latencies for a single model.

### Running Tests
The project includes a test suite to ensure correctness and stability. To run the tests, use the following command:

Bash

./run test
The output will report the number of test cases passed and the overall line coverage percentage. The test suite requires at least 80% coverage to pass.

### Logging
The application generates logs to help with debugging and monitoring. Logging behavior is controlled by two environment variables:

$LOG_FILE: The absolute path to the log file.

$LOG_LEVEL: The verbosity level for logging.

0: Silent (default)

1: Informational messages

2: Debug messages
